title: GOV.UK content
---

The [digital communications team](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx) have provided a guide on what you need to do in order to get content published on GOV.UK

They also have published the DFE content strategy which is worth a read to [understand how we (DfE) approach content on GOV.UK](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx).

If you do not have access to the guidance please email the team: [insert]

These are the principles we use:

* only create content where there’s a proven user need
* design content for the user need by ensuring:
     * it only includes what the user needs to know
     * it doesn't have a lengthy policy introduction
     * it doesn't explain why something is the way it is in great detail
     * it's structured around what users need to know and the headings reflect that
* create content in the format that the user needs it to be in; HTML should be the default (depending on the user need) as it's the most usable and most accessible
* write in plain English and use the language that our audience use to make it easier for people to read and understand
* ensure it’s in the correct GOV.UK format and in GOV.UK style

This list also shows the order of importance of these principles, if we’re unable to meet them all with a specific request or project. For example, we’d rather publish something designed around users’ needs that’s usable and easy to read that doesn’t 100% follow GOV.UK style than to have something that doesn’t meet users’ needs.

GOV.UK users will spot bad content before they notice style inconsistencies across the whole site.
