## Hello from the DfE content design community ðŸŽ‰

These are the standards we work to as content designers at DfE. 

This guidance will help

* new content designer joining DfE understand our ways of working so that I can get going and get the right support to get started
* DfE staff understand how to work with content designers to delivery high quality guidance and services
* any members of staff wanting to know what skills are required to become a content designer

This is not an L&D tool â€“ we have the [Trello toolkit](https://trello.com/b/DwkYOqDi/content-design-toolkit-in-beta) for that. 

This is not a tool to deliver professional development â€“ we have [the content design community](https://trello.com/b/lsijeDj5/dfe-content-designers-community) for that. 

This is not an induction tool â€“ we have the Civil Service induction for that, and you should also have a team induction. Speak to your line manager.
