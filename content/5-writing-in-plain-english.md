Writing in plain English

We use plain English to:

* make it easy for people to understand our content
* to reduce the time needed to digest our content
* to make our content more readable and scanable

There are tools you can use to help you write in plain English:

* [Hemingway editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
* [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)

There are also online courses and further resources available in our [Content Design Toolkit on Trello](https://trello.com/b/DwkYOqDi/content-design-toolkit-in-beta).
