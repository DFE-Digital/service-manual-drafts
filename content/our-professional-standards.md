title: Our professional standards
---

As content designers within the civil servies, we work to the standards published in: 

* [Content creation and publishing guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer)
* [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
* [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)

We are part of the user-centred design profession family. You can [find what we do and what skills you need to become one](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer).

Minimum standards for any content:

* be written to the GDS content style, applying DfE, ESFA or other where applicable
* be structured to help the audience read through it
* be named appropriately and therefore findable by search engines 
* have been checked by another content designer or appropriate person (2 eyed) before publication
* be accessible and in a format that meets accessibility requirements 
* be in the correct format for its type of content
* have the correct level of clearance through a sign off process

For any content on our main DfE channels, for example GOV.UK, Apprenticeships website or our social media, must be planned in with the appropriate communications team.
