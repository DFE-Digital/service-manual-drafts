## Hello from the DfE content design community ðŸŽ‰

These are the standards we work to as content designers at DfE. 

This guidance will help:

* new content designer joining DfE understand our ways of working so that they can confidently get started
* DfE staff understand how to work with content designers to delivery high quality guidance and services
* any members of staff wanting to know what skills are required to become a content designer

This is not a form of induction, we have the Civil Service induction for that. You should also have a team induction, speak to your line manager about that.

This is not an L&D tool, we have the [Trello toolkit](https://trello.com/b/DwkYOqDi/content-design-toolkit-in-beta) for that. 

This is not a professional development or support resource, we have [the content design community](https://trello.com/b/lsijeDj5/dfe-content-designers-community) for that. 

Our content design community is not restricted to the profession and we join up with our colleagues across other professions too.

## Content design in government

As content designers within the civil servies, we work to the standards published in: 

* [Content creation and publishing guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer)
* [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
* [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)

We are part of the user-centred design profession family. [Find out more about what it takes to be a content designer](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer).

We have a DfE wide [communications strategy](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx), which we also need to use when creating content. 

The following guidance will help you understand how we can work togther at DfE:

* user needs, start with them and remember they will change over time
* it's not just about the words
* accessibility, it's the law
* how to write well
* test with users, get feedback and iterate
* monitor anlytics and performance, continue to iterate and improve
* when will it end

## Publishing on GOV.UK

The [digital communications team](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx) have provided a guide on what you need to do in order to get content published on GOV.UK

They also have published the DFE content strategy which is worth a read to [understand how we (DfE) approach content on GOV.UK](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx).

If you do not have access to the guidance please email the team: [insert]

These are the principles we use:

* only create content where thereâ€™s a proven user need
* design content for the user need by ensuring:
     * it only includes what the user needs to know
     * it doesn't have a lengthy policy introduction
     * it doesn't explain why something is the way it is in great detail
     * it's structured around what users need to know and the headings reflect that
* create content in the format that the user needs it to be in; HTML should be the default (depending on the user need) as it's the most usable and most accessible
* write in plain English and use the language that our audience use to make it easier for people to read and understand
* ensure itâ€™s in the correct GOV.UK format and in GOV.UK style

This list also shows the order of importance of these principles, if weâ€™re unable to meet them all with a specific request or project. For example, weâ€™d rather publish something designed around usersâ€™ needs thatâ€™s usable and easy to read that doesnâ€™t 100% follow GOV.UK style than to have something that doesnâ€™t meet usersâ€™ needs.

GOV.UK users will spot bad content before they notice style inconsistencies across the whole site.

## From ESFA

Minimum standards for any content:

* be written to the GDS content style, applying DfE, ESFA or other where applicable
* be structured to help the audience read through it
* be named appropriately and therefore findable by search engines 
* have been checked by another content designer or appropriate person (2 eyed) before publication
* be accessible and in a format that meets accessibility requirements 
* be in the correct format for its type of content
* have the correct level of clearance through a sign off process

For any content on our main DfE channels, for example GOV.UK, Apprenticeships website or our social media, must be planned in with the appropriate communications team.
