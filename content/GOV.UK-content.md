The [digital communications team](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx) have provided a guide on what you need to do in order to get content published on GOV.UK

They also have published the DFE content strategy which is worth a read to [understand how we (DfE) approach content on GOV.UK](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx).

If you do not have access to the guidance please email the team: [insert]
