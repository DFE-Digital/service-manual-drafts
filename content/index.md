## Hello from the DfE content design community 🎉

These are the standards we work to as content designers at DfE. 

This guidance will help

* new content designer joining DfE understand our ways of working so that they can confidently get started
* DfE staff understand how to work with content designers to delivery high quality guidance and services
* any members of staff wanting to know what skills are required to become a content designer

Our content design community is not restricted to the profession and we join up with our colleagues across other professions too.

This is not an L&D tool – we have the [Trello toolkit](https://trello.com/b/DwkYOqDi/content-design-toolkit-in-beta) for that. 

This is not a professional development resource – we have [the content design community](https://trello.com/b/lsijeDj5/dfe-content-designers-community) for that. 

This is not a form of induction – we have the Civil Service induction for that, and you should also have a team induction. Speak to your line manager.

## Content design in government

As content designers within the civil servies, we work to the standards published in: 

* [Content creation and publishing guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer)
* [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
* [Style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style)

We are part of the user-centred design profession family. You can [find what we do and what skills you need to become one](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-designer).

The [digital communications team](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx) have provided a guide on what you need to do in order to get content published on GOV.UK

They also have published the DFE content strategy which is worth a read to [understand how we (DfE) approach content on GOV.UK](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx).

If you do not have access to the guidance please email the team: [insert]

The following guidance will help you understand how we can work togther:

* user needs, start with them and remember they will change over time
* it's not just about the words
* accessibility, it's the law
* test with users, get feedback and iterate
* monitor anlytics and performance, continue to iterate and improve
